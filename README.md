In this assignment we are going to build an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity datasetLinks to an external site., which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.



# For this challenge I did the following:

## Part 1 Import Data & Create A Bar Chart

* Imported the data from samples.json using the D3 Library.
* Created a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.
* Used sample values as values for the bar chart

## Part 2 Create A Bubble Chart

* Created a bubble chart that corresponds to what was chosen in the dropdown menu
* Used sample the values as values for y-axis of the bar chart
* Used OTU IDs as the values for x-axis of the bar chart

## Part 3: Displayed Demographic Data & Key Pairs

* Displayed the sample metadata of the selected individual's in the dropdown box demographic information
* Displayed each key-value pair from the metadata JSON objecton the page.

## Part 4: Update The Display Via New Dropdown Box Selection

* Update the bar chart & bubble chart when a new sample is selected in the dropdown box.

## Part 5: Update The Display Via New Dropdown Box Selection

* Deploy your app to GitHub Pages and posted link to page - https://thesolecloset.github.io/Belly-Button-challenge/
